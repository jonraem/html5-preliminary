Author: Joni Rämö

About
-
There are some custom changes in the library and framework source files:
* Custom change in _tables.scss (padding-left).
* Custom changes in _pagination.scss.
* Custom changes in scss/_customVariables.scss.
* Custom changes in jquery-ui.css.

Technologies used:
* Bootstrap
* jQuery
* jQuery UI
* SCSS

Instructions
-
* Installation should require no effort. Just download the ZIP and open index.html.
* Table entries are saved into localStorage as JSON, so no virtual servers are required.
* Write "test_me" into the name field to add entries without form validation.

Status
-
There are still a few things missing from the perfect version.
* Pagination of table entries.
* Sorting of table entries by name, gender or age.
* Enhanced responsivity. Responsive modal dialog.
* Code refactoring. Optimization.
